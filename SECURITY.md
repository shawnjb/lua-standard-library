# Security

A general overview of the security guidelines.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

When a network based module or algorithm is implemented; vulnurabilities are possible. In the case of an active vulnurability, message me [directly on discord](https://discord.com/users/1043411743424139295) or [report a vulnurability privately on this repository](https://github.com/shawnjb/lua-standard-library/security) before taking any action on your behalf.

## Questions Answered

> What measures can I take to tackle vulnurabilities with the data structures & algorithms provided from this repository?

In the case of using algorithms & structures; you should always question the integrity of your client & server logic. Does the algorithm belong on the client? Should you maintain a data structure locally or on the server? The answer to this question is what you see fit. You should always have a user reports portal of sorts to recieve reports of problems & vulnurabilities with your software.

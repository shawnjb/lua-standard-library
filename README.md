This repository is undergoing a major rewrite. The new version will be released soon.

## Developer Notes

Expected file structure in the future may look like this:

* A top-level directory called src that contains all of the source code for the library.

* Within the src directory, subdirectories organized by module or functionality. For example, one subdirectory for sorting algorithms, one for data structures, etc.

* Each subdirectory would contain one or more Lua files, where each file defines a module, class, or set of related functions.A top-level directory called tests that contains test files for the library.

* An additional top-level directory called docs for documentation of library usage and usage examples. This is just one possible file structure, but this one is more maintainable and understandable for other developers who would like to use it and can also help to improve code reusability.
